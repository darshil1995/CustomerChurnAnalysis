# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn patterns using a telecommunications dataset, visualized through Power BI. The goal is to identify drivers behind churn behavior and generate actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Total Customers:** 7,043  
- **Churned Customers:** 1,869  
- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.54%  
- **Revenue Insights:**
  - Monthly Charges: ~$456,120  
  - Total Lifetime Charges: ~$16.06 million  

## 🧠 Key Findings

### 1. 🔎 Churn by Tenure & Demographics
- **Tenure Impact:** Short-tenured customers exhibit the highest churn risk. As tenure increases, churn probability diminishes, indicating stronger loyalty among long-term users.
- **Dependents & Partners:**
  - Customers **without dependents** and **without partners** show higher churn.
  - Indicates correlation between lifestyle factors and retention.
- **Gender:** Little difference in churn rates between male and female customers.

### 2. 💳 Billing & Payment Preferences
- **Paperless Billing:** Customers opting for paperless billing churn more frequently—potentially linked to digital-first users being less brand-loyal or more price-sensitive.
- **Payment Methods:**  
  - **Electronic Check** users show the highest churn.  
  - **Automatic transfers (bank/credit card)** and **mailed checks** correlate with lower churn rates.

### 3. 📦 Services & Subscription Patterns
- Churn increases with **3–5 subscribed services**, indicating possible customer overwhelm or dissatisfaction.
- Customers with either minimal (1–2) or extensive (6–9) service usage churn less—suggesting a "sweet spot" for bundled offerings.

### 4. 🗓️ Contract Type Influence
- **Monthly Contracts:** Highest churn rate at 42.71%  
- **One-Year Contracts:** Moderate churn rate at 11.27%  
- **Two-Year Contracts:** Lowest churn rate at 2.83%  
- Longer contracts indicate customer stability and are a strong indicator of retention.

## 💡 Business Implications

- **Promote longer-term contracts** with incentives to reduce churn.
- **Enhance loyalty programs** for monthly users to build commitment.
- **Target electronic check users** with personalized retention campaigns.
- **Optimize bundled services** to align with customer satisfaction trends.
